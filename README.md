# Prediction of HVPG in patients with liver cirrhosis
**Hepatic venous pressure gradient (HVPG)** is an important prognosis marker in advanced chronic liver disease (cirrhosis). An HVPG value equal to or above 16 mmHg indicates high probability of serious complications (decompensation). Because HVPG is measured by an invasive procedure, its prediction from other clinical parameters is highly desirable.

In this project, we first explored data collected in the [Vienna Cirrhosis Study](https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT03267615) for compensated patients (without apparent serious symptoms). Each patient record contained an HVPG measurement as well as a large number of other clinical parameters. The aim was to select 5 or 3 optimal parameters for **detection of high-risk patients** with an HVPG value equal to or above 16.
